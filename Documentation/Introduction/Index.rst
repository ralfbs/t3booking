What does it do?
----------------

This extension provides a booking system, yet an other one, we have to say. What is different in this one?
- flexible booking durations between a couple of minutes and a whole day (30 minutes as default)
- flexible capacity: while other solutions allow to book or not to book an item, this one gives the option to reserve some parts of the total capacity, e.g. seats
- Calender shows the number of free and booked seats.

This chapter should help people figure how the extension works. Remove it
if not relevant.
